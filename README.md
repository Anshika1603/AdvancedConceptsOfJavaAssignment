# AdvancedConceptsOfJavaAssignment
Assignment1:  Write a java program as per the below-given specification:

i) Design a Dish class having dishID, dishName, creationTime as the attributes. To initialize the attributes of the class and create a parameterized constructor. Also override the toString() method to print the object's details on the console.
ii) Design a Menu class having menuList as an attribute which is a static ArrayList. Load the menuList with a Dish object comprising some sample dishes using a static block.
iii) Design a Restaurant class comprising the main method. It should give a menu driven interface to a user as follows:
Press 1 to display Dishes.
Press 2 to search Dish.
iv) On the click of 1 all the dishes offered by the restaurant should be displayed to a user.
v) On the click of 2 it prompts the user to enter the dishID, if the ID entered matches with the dish, its details should be printed on the console.

The Program should be running without any errors.

Assignment2: 
Q1: Write a lambda expression that accepts two integer arguments and returns the max of them.
Q2: Write a lambda expression that accepts a long value and returns a next-even number.

- The code should be running without errors
- Proper output should be there

Assignment3: Write a lambda expression that accepts seven string arguments and returns a string in upper case concatenated from all of them (in the order of arguments).

Sample Input:

The lambda has too many string arguments.
Sample Output:

THELAMBDAHASTOOMANYSTRINGARGUMENTS.

Assignment4: Write a lambda expression that accepts a list of strings and returns new list of distinct strings (without repeating). The order of elements in the result list may be any (elements will be sorted by the testing system).

If the input list doesn't contain any strings then the result list should be empty.

Hints: it is possible to use sets, maps, lists and so on for helping.

Sample Input 1:
java scala java clojure clojure
Sample Output 1:
clojure java scala
Sample Input 2:
the three the three the three an an a
Sample Output 2:
a an the three
